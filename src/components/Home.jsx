      <p>
        I bring communication, enthusiasm & programming prowess. With a
        background in computer networking & support, I know how to interface
        with both co- workers & clients to effectively communicate about
        technology. I am finishing up my time at a 20-week full-stack web &
        mobile application development program where I learned agile
        methodologies with a focus on behavior-driven development. I am
        effective in working independently & in collaboration with a team. My
        strong suits include attention to detail, documentation, propensity for
        efficiency & an ever- growing desire to learn more.
