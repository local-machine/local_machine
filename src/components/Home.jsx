      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
      I bring communication, enthusiasm & programming prowess. 
      With a background in computer networking, I know how to interface with both co-workers & clients to effectively communicate about technology. 
      Currently, I work as a software engineer where I contribute to a full-stack utilizing object-oriented programming. 
      I am effective in working independently & in collaboration with a team. 
      My strong suits include attention to detail, documentation & an ever-growing desire to learn more.
