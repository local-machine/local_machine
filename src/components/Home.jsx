      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I bring communication, enthusiasm & programming prowess. With a
        background in computer networking & support, I know how to interface
        with both co-workers & clients to effectively communicate about
        technology. I recently finished a 20-week program where I learned
        object-oriented programming, agile methodologies with a focus on
        behavior-driven development. I am effective in working independently &
        in collaboration with a team. My strong suits include attention to
        detail, documentation, efficiency & an ever-growing desire to learn
        more.
